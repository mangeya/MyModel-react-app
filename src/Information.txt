I structured it with a clear hierarchy—profile details, collapsible topics, and events sections—
JSX for layout and inline styles for a modern design with gradients and shadows
React’s useState hook to handle the profile image upload and section expansions
TypeScript interfaces enforcing data consistency, aligning with a scalable, user-friendly design.



Type Definitions: UserData and UserStatCardProps interfaces define data structure and props.
Main Component: UserStatCard uses useState for state (image, section visibility), handles events (image upload), and renders JSX with inline styles.
Styling: styles object provides CSS-like properties.
